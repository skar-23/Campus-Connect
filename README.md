## How can I deploy to GitHub Pages?

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. Here's how it works:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to the `main` branch triggers an automatic build and deployment via GitHub Actions.

2. **Manual Setup**: To enable GitHub Pages for your repository:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings > Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically deploy your site

3. **Access Your Site**: Once deployed, your site will be available at:
   `https://[your-username].github.io/Campus-Connect/`

4. **Local Development**: For local development, the app runs with base path `/` (root), but production builds use `/Campus-Connect/` for GitHub Pages compatibility.
